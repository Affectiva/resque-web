resque-web
==========

A Rails-based frontend to the [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) job
queue system. This provides a similar interface to the existing Sinatra
application that comes bundled with Resque, but deploys like a Rails application
and leverages Rails conventions for factoring things like controllers, helpers,
and views.

More documentation coming soon!
